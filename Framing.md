Supervised Machine learning -
     ML Systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never before seen data.
     
     
## Labels
   A __label__ or the -y variable is the thing we are predicting in simple linear regression. The label could be the future price of wheat, the kind of animal shown in a picture, the meaning of an audio clip, or just about anything.
   
## Feature
   A feature is an input variableâ€”the x variable in simple linear regression. A simple machine learning project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated machine learning project could use millions of features, specified as:

```
                         X1,X2,X3,... Xn
```
