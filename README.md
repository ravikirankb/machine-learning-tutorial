# machine-learning-tutorial
Basic machine learning concepts and exercises that walks through basic concepts of machine learning.

# Preface
I have made an attempt to learn and at the same time crate a basic machine learning project which can help understand the important concepts in as less time as possible by providing the sample codes with explanations to understand differnet machine learning algorithms. I have tried to skim through the machine learning crash course from developers.google.com
to provide most relevant and as less content as possible for ease of understanding and speed of learning.

#### Credits and learnings from, code is mostly taken from the course material, i have added some explanations and modifications wherever i could
