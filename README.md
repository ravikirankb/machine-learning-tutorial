# machine-learning-tutorial
Basic machine learning concepts and tutorials with examples to quickly get familiar with the concepts of machine learning

# Preface
I have made an attempt to create a machine learning tutorial for beginners to quickly understand the important concepts in as less time as possible by providing simple definitions and various code examples to demonstrate the working of each machine learning algorithm. I have tried to skim through the machine learning crash course from developers.google.com
to provide most relevant and as less content as possible for ease of understanding and speed of learning.

# Credits and learnings from, code is mostly taken from the course material, i have added some explanations and modifications wherever i could
